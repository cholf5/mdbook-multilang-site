# Writing with Markdown

This template renders Markdown on the client side using [Marked](https://marked.js.org/).

1. Keep filenames consistent across languages so that navigation stays in sync.
2. Use relative links when referencing other chapters (for example `../en/writing-with-markdown.md`).
3. Embed images by placing them in the `images/` folder and referencing them with standard Markdown syntax.

> Tip: store reusable text like disclaimers or author notes in partial Markdown files and include them with a build step if needed.
